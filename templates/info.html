					The categorization task is based on a rule that <b>you will have to guess</b> based on the examples that
					will be shown to you.
					The experiment is divided in three parts.
				</p>
				<p>
					<li> Initially, you will be shown some of the images and their associated categories, <b>marked by either
					0 or 1.</b></li></p>
                    <p>
                <li> Then, you will be asked to categorize some new images. <b>You will receive feedback</b> on whether or not
					you chose the right category for each image.</li></p>
                
                    <p>
					During this first phase, <b>you should try to infer the rule</b> based on the feedback you receive.
				</p>
				<p>
					<li>The last step is the testing phase, you will again be asked to categorize some images but
                        <b>feedback won't be provided.</b></li>
